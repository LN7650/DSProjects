Project in Data Scientist Nanodegree of Udacity
Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in the BlackFriday Dataset as a shopper who likes to shop during blackfriday:
1.	Which users did maximum purchase ? List Top 30 spending users
2.	Now lets see if we can get the age group of the users who spent more  and also what gender is shopping the most. 
3.	we will see what products are most popular during the sales event
4.	Out of curiosity I tried to see if the theory of married couple spending less is correct! 
File Descriptions 
Attaching the file which is used for analysis- I have used Python 2 as this is what I have installed in my PC. 
It also includes the results of the analysis as well.
